# Credit Card Default Prediction

Credit Card fraud is the most pressing issue which has to be dealt with by card issuing companies. This problem has been around for decades and this project focuses on these frauds taking place. 

**Dataset :** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)


The problem under consideration is addressed using the feature selection methods and re-sampling like oversampling techniques. It uses various ML techniques such as **Dummy
classifier (baseline), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Neighbors, Random For-
est, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks and Gaussian Naive Bayes**
to detect frauds. The performance of each of the methods
is compared based on four different parameters: Recall, F1-Score, Ac-
curacy, and Precision. A dataset of credit cards is used to evaluate the
efficiency of the different ML techniques, purely based on the filter features selection method. 

The outcomes of this experiment show that the accuracy and other parameters of **XGBoost** are the highest. But when performed the **Nemenyi test** it was found that **Random Forest** had the least average rank, thus revealing that Random Forest performed the best on average.

## Lessons Learnt
It was a fun toy project to get hands-on-experience with the data mining concepts taught in the class. And, gained experience using one of the most popular machine learning libraries scikit-learn to solve real problems.



## Coursework
This project was for fulfillment of the one of the course requirements for the course: **CSI 5387 : Data Mining**
